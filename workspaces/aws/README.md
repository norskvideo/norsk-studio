This is the bome of components that *should not be used in production*.

They are either non-operational or here to serve as a good starting point into making a real version of whatever the component does in its happy path.

They lack the complete test harness required to belong in the built-ins workspace, probably lack sensible behaviour around source restarts, validation, etc.

If something in here is potentially of commercial use to please feel free to reach out for advice or help in turning the component into something that is production ready.
