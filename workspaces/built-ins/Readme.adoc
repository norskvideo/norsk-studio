== workspaces/built-ins

This built-ins directory contains a collection of the default components available for use within Studio.
Its package.json builds a manifest for everything found in 'src' in src/index.ts, as well as building a client-side bundle for all of them.

=== Structure

Inside the 'src' folder, we have several subdirectories with components that do one of the following things:

- Inputs: Modules that define how media streams are ingested.
- Processors: Modules that handle the transformation or analysis of media streams.
- Outputs: Modules that define how media streams are delivered to their destinations.

Using Norsk Studio, we can combine these components to build some rather complicated media workflows seamlessly.

The documentation for each of the components can be found within the component's folder Readme.
