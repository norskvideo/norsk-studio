This component outputs multiple media streams over UDP in TS (Transport Stream) format. It accepts multiple input streams and sends them to a specified IP address and port. Key settings include the port for output, the destination IP, buffer delay in milliseconds, and the network interface to bind to. The component ensures that the UDP output is configured correctly with validations for port, IP address, buffer delay, and interface.
