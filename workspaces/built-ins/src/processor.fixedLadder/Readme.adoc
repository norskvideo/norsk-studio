== Encode Ladder
The Fixed Ladder Encoder is a processor component for encoding a single input video stream into multiple encoded renditions. It creates an encoding ladder, where each &#x60;rung&#x60; represents a different quality level or rendition of the original video, typically varying in resolution and bitrate.

=== Features
* Encodes a single video stream into multiple renditions.
* Supports both software and hardware-accelerated encoding.
* Configurable encode settings for each rung (resolution, bitrate, codec settings)
* Supports multiple codec types: H.264, HEVC(H.265)
* Hardware acceleration support for AMD MA35D, NVIDIA, Quadra, and Logan.
