== Encode Ladder
The Fixed Ladder Encoder is a processor component for encoding a single input video stream into multiple encoded renditions. It creates an encoding ladder, where each &#x60;rung&#x60; represents a different quality level or rendition of the original video, typically varying in resolution and bitrate.
