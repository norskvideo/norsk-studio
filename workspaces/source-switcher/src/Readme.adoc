=== Source Switcher
This component manages multiple A/V (audio and video) streams from different sources, switching between the sources dynamically. It accepts multiple input streams containing both audio and video and produces a single output stream with synchronized A/V content. The component ensures that each input stream contains both audio and video from the same source - any mismatch or missing media will trigger a validation error.
